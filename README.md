## Me
Let me jump right into this, I love programming it's such good out let for creativity. I am a full stack web developer who has as serious problem with learning, I nerver stop...

I love innovate or simplify solutions, turning complex challenges into elegant, efficient systems, moving fast, and spending too long doing something I really didn't need to do in the first place but wanted to automate it with "AI" (It was just a bash script, don't tell my CTO ðŸ˜…).

Always looking to expand my knowledge as much as possible and build connections.

Lighthearted.

Was a student at The Learning People (IRE) Ltd for about a year and a half before I began working for my first company, IDS.company were I am currently working on a performance description platform that is fully community based. There I work as a lead developer with many technologies & languges: Go, Svelte, Typescript/Javascrip, Digital ocean, AWS and Vercel. And building my team management skills.

 I am Markuss, nice to meet you...

## Me
Let me jump right into this, I love programming it's such good out let for creativity...

Is what I would say if I was trying to be protracted, but to be honest, I like to make things that, work, go fast, and spend too long doing something I really didn't need to do in the first place but wanted to automate it with "AI" (bash script, don't tell my CEO).

Always looking to expand my knowledge as much as possible and build connections.

Pretty lighthearted.

As a student at The Learning People (IRE) Ltd for about a year and a half before I began working for my first company, IDS.company were I am currently working on a performance description platform that is fully community based. There I work as a lead developer on this fantastic project forward, and building my team management skills.

 I am Markuss, good to meet you...
